This project aims to design a reinforcement learning (RL)-based trading algorithm that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies in market data, comparing the performance of LSTM-augmented models (PPOLSTM and SACLSTM) against standard RL models (PPO and SAC) to optimize returns in volatile market conditions.
